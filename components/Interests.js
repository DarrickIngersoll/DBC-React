            <p className="interests-p">I have a passion for technology and enjoy activities such as building PCs, mechanical keyboards, and exploring the world of audio equipment such as headphones, DACs, and Amps. I also have a love for automotive work and restoration, particularly on classic Datsuns and Nissans. I am also a motorsport enthusiast and often attend local drift, rally, F1, and sport GT races on the rare occasion that they come through.</p>
