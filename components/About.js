                I made a career transition into front-end design and development after having gained experience in vector art for business and sports team branding. My first project in the field was designing and developing the front-end of a website for a chapter of a non-profit organization for combat veterans. This experience has sparked my interest in further developing my skills in the field and I am currently pursuing an education in Javascript and React. I have a strong desire to continue expanding my knowledge down the stack to include Express, MongoDB, and Node.js.
